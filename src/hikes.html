    Normally this is a busy trail, but since the road is currently closed there were only a few 
    people out on the trail. 
      Some highlights of the hike:
      <ul>
        <li>Hiking on a closed highway with some nice views.</li>
        <li>Climbing over snow-covered lava beds at the top.</li>
        <li>The actual trail to the waterfall was fairly short and easy once we got to the top.</li>
      </ul>

      This was supposed to be an easy 6-mile hike, but it turned into a 10+-mile hike since we parked 
      at the wrong trailhead. It was still fun!
      Some highlights of the hike:
      <ul>
        <li>A variety of landscape and scenery: sandy dunes, forest, hills, and a lake.</li>
        <li>Newts! There were a bunch of newts in the forested areas.</li>
        <li>The beach was relatively warm (usually when I go it's pretty windy).</li>
      </ul>
